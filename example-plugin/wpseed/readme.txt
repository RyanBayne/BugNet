== Version Numbers Explained ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the TwitchPress plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
